# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 16-02-2026

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Zap Voz ("the App") handles user information.

We value your privacy. The App was designed to function without collecting, storing, or sharing personal data.

---

## Information We Collect

The App does **not collect, store, or transmit any personal information**.

We do not collect:
- Name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Location data
- Contacts
- Usage analytics
- Device identifiers
- Audio recordings

---

## Audio Recordings

The App allows users to record audio using their device’s microphone.

All recordings:
- Are stored locally on the user's device
- Are never uploaded to our servers
- Are never accessed by the developer
- Are only shared when the user explicitly chooses to share them via third-party applications (e.g., messaging apps)

We do not have access to any recorded content.

---

## Third-Party Services

The App may allow sharing content via third-party applications such as messaging platforms.

Please note that once content is shared through third-party services, their respective privacy policies apply. We are not responsible for how third-party services handle shared content.

---

## Data Storage

All data generated by the App remains solely on the user's device unless the user decides to share it externally.

We do not operate any servers that store user data.

---

## Security

Because we do not collect or store personal data, there is no transmission of personal information to external servers.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be reflected by revising the "Last updated" date.
